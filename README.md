# Astronomy Page

Forked project of the /final-project.

My idea is to continue improving my skills in the back-end part using Node.js.

This web app is being built using React.js and Redux on the frontend and ExpressJS, and MongoDB on the backend. 
For the style, we are using styled-components and the React library called MUI.

Our main idea was to create a community and give users the ability to search for things about astronomy like images and descriptions about them, but at the same time, users can interact with each other through posts and comments.
